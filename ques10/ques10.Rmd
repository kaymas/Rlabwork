## Program to implement matrices addition, subtraction, and multiplication

Writing a function to get a random 2x2 matrix
```{r}
getMatrix <- function(){
  tempMat = matrix(sample(-10:10, size = 4, replace = TRUE), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
  return (tempMat)
}
```

### Matrix Addition

```{r}
A <- getMatrix()
B <- getMatrix()
```

Matrix A is
```{r echo=FALSE}
A
```

Matrix B is
```{r echo=FALSE}
B
```

Sum of A and B is
```{r}
A + B
```

### Matrix Difference

```{r}
A <- getMatrix()
B <- getMatrix()
```

Matrix A is
```{r echo=FALSE}
A
```

Matrix B is
```{r echo=FALSE}
B
```

Difference of A and B is
```{r}
A - B
```

### Matrix Multiplication

```{r}
A <- getMatrix()
B <- getMatrix()
```

Matrix A is
```{r echo=FALSE}
A
```

Matrix B is
```{r echo=FALSE}
B
```

Sum of A and B is
```{r}
A %*% B
```
