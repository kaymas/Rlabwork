# Rlabwork

A repo dump for data science class labwork.  
The questions are labelled by their question number and they each sit in their separate folders. This repo also contains some extra code snippets that aren't question but are related to the functions used in the questions.

Instead of creating a `.R` extension file I have used the [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) package to create `.Rmd` extension file that stands for R-markdown. Each code snippet have a `*.Rmd` file(R-markdown) and a `*.md` file(markdown). The `*.md` file contains the output of `*.rmd` file. You can directly look at the `*.md` file for the code.
